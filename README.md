### Hello, I'm Micah üëã

## I'm a 5th Year Senior Undergraduate majoring in Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering 
Currently, this repository is used to hold the algorithms that I made for my Machine Learning Course with SDSMT. Please understand that I live in low-level land and have not touched Python or any other high-level language in over two years. This is probably the programs of a mad man, but that is exactly how I describe my coding style. I will try to get my VHDL code for a a custom ARM CPU that I made on a FPGA last year. 

I am a hardware guy first and a software guy second. This class, Machine Learning, was a challenge as I have not touched high-level languagues in over 2 years, so Python was shocking to my electrical roots. 

Lastly, yes. I should have gone for the masters in Electrical Engineering instead of the double major. I am currently trying to rectify this mistake by building a time machine. 

### Courese Work
Below is a list of classes I have completed in my 5 years at SDSMT. All Computer Engnieering, or Computer Science, Classes will be signified üñ•Ô∏è with and all Electrical Classes will be signified with ‚ö°. I will inlcude all Computer Sciecne Classes under Computer Engineering. Math Classes will be signified with üßÆ.

### Languauges
I primaraly code in Python now, but most of my Data Structures work was done in C++ and I have done a lot of C programing. I also know ARMv8 pretty well as my Assembly Languauge course was in ARMv8, but I have doen MIPS. Lastly, I have dabbeled in VHDL and Julia for two of my courses.

### Current Repositories
Here is a list of the up to date repositories: 
## Partial-Difficult (Research Project in modeling PDE's)
- The goal of this project was to introduce a method of testing motility values calculated using a set of partial differential equations that predict the path of a deer with Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) over various landscapes. The combination of Cellular Automata and Perlin Noise allows for pseudo-random, but repeatable terrain to be created, that allow a list of calculated motility values to be simulated by our silicon friends.
## Machine Learning (Solo Class Project)
- Perceptron
- Low VC-Dimenssion
  - Threshold 
  - Interval
- Linear Regression 
- Logistic Regression
- K Nearest Neighbor 
- Soft SVM
## Natrual Computing (Class Programs w/ partners)
- ANN
- Reward Learning
- Cellular Automata
- Genetic Mutation 
- Simulated Annealing / Hill Climbing
